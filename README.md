# Lamport_algorithm
The memory management simulator illustrates page fault behavior in a paged virtual memory system. The program reads the initial state of the page table and a sequence of virtual memory instructions and writes a trace log indicating the effect of each instruction. It includes a graphical user interface so that students can observe page replacement algorithms at work. Students may be asked to implement a particular page replacement algorithm which the instructor can test by comparing the output from the student's algorithm to that produced by a working implementation.
